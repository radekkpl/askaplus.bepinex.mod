<code style="color:red;">BACKUP YOUR SAVE</code>\
This is still in development
This mod does not change any game files. It can be uninstalled without problem, your game/save file is not harmed.
Mod is tested only on single player session ! - Yet.

## Torches to buildings
Torches has been added to buildings.  Your village is now lit and not that dark in the night. (Cart too :))

## Spikes self damage reduction
Originally spikes do 5 damage to enemy and 20 damage to itself. This is pretty annoying, because pack of smolkers can easily destroy your perimeter.\
Self damage to walls is now reduced to 2.

## Walls / Towers anchors fix
Currently in game there is a gap about 0,3m between walls when using snapping. This gap is now reduced to 0.
It will works only for new Wall created.

## Paint grass
You can press "]" key to paint grass in front of you (3m). Rebind the key in config file or in in game settings (not yet implemented).\
In next version of mod, you will have to hold specific tool in hand to prevent accidentally paint grass on stone road for example.

## Food PATCH
Increased duration effects from 60sec to 5min.

## Seed PATCH
Seeds decay rate significantly increased to avoid seeds everywhere (please get feedback if is too high or still to low and on which decay settings you play).

## How to enable / disable some features
- Mod has ingame settings (Enable/disable feature, etc.) in game settings menu.
