## Spikes self damage reduction
Originally spikes do 5 damage to enemy and 20 damage to itself. This is pretty annoying, because pack of smolkers can easily destroy your perimeter.\
Self damage to walls is now reduced to 2.

Currently in game there is a gap about 0,3m between walls when using snapping. This gap is now reduced to 0.
It will works only for new Wall created.
